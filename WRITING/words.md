The two maps reflect the main change in Canadian park after a renovation work during two decades from 1995 to 2015.

Overall, new transport system facilities like shuttle bus route, biking trails have built in park. Meanwhile, Highway 25 road and marina stayed untouched in terms of geolocation.

It is seen that in 2015 shuttle bus routes connected each shttle bus stop, hence it significantly saved Canadian park visitor's time and improved park's logistics. Moreover, there were not walking and biking trails in 1995, however the situation changed allowing people to walk from campsite, next to the marina, to one of the shuttle bus stop, which was in hand to river and waterfall.

While new buildings were built, some of the vital objects for park did not remove. Parking area and information station changed their location, as the result of renovation project and improvements in transport system in the park, parking area was dramatically extended. The area of campsites were also increased, that is why park's visitors were able to eat in cafe in 2015.
